- Replace all hijacked /team translatables with proper messages
	- Long term, some other form of translation would be good
- save items from before join: possibly prevent nbt write if player is in a shared inventory?
- allow for a default shared group that is joined automatically for new players?
- rename "unknown shared inventory" to "unknown inventory" and the like
- let inventories be bound to mc teams (!!)
- import path cleanup
